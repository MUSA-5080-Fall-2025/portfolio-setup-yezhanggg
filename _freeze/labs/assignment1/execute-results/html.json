The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

The high margin of error could because these are counties that have low population and the data could easily skewed.]\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\nselected_counties <- county_data %>%\n  filter(NAME %in% c(\"Los Angeles\", \"Trinity\", \"Tehama\")) %>%\n  select(NAME, median_incomeE, income_moe_pct, reliability_category)\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\nprint(selected_counties)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  NAME        median_incomeE income_moe_pct reliability_category\n  <chr>                <dbl>          <dbl> <chr>               \n1 Los Angeles          83411          0.526 High Confidence     \n2 Tehama               59029          6.95  Moderate Confidence \n3 Trinity              47317         12.4   Low Confidence      \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** [Los Angeles has a High Confidence category because of its extremely low income margin of error percent. This is because Los Angeles is one of the most populated county and that lead to low margin of error. On the another other hand, Tehama has a income margin of error percentage around 7 and Trinity is at 12. The data for Tehama and Trinity are less reliable compare to Los Angeles County.]\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

The only one tract without HIGH MOE Issue has a population 0f 8994.]\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n[I think the most important takeaway from this assignment is the important of sampling size. This situation has appear in multiple analysis and multple times. If a data has some reliability issue, one of the characteristic of that data is the small sampling size.\n\nThe community that faced the greatest risk of algorithmic bias is Trinity. Trinity only has 4 census tract and it such a small county that the data could highly likely to be skewed because of sampling error. It is also show as a \"Low Confidence\" in county level income data. The interpretation and result could be really not reliable due to data quality issue.\n\nThe root cause may be the survey design and also just how insufficient for the data to be reliable if we want to look at small geographic areas like census tracts. Rural places like Trinity and Tehama make reliable sampling really challenging. \n\nI think one of the most important is to apply strict MOE thresholds. Data that are not reliable especially on small sample and big geographic area it is really important to examine the data closely. Aggregate the data and looking at large scale is necessary if the public organization want to implement any policies. Careful decision making process is necessary and key for community success. ]\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n:::

Alameda, Butte, Calaveras, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Fresno, Humboldt, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Lake, Los Angeles, Madera, Marin, Mendocino, Merced, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Placer, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, Ventura, Yolo, Yuba. These county are in the high confidence category for the new decision making framework.]\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [Counties need additional oversight are Amador, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Inyo, Lassen, Mariposa, Modoc, San Benito, Tehama, Tuolumne. These county are in the moderate confidence category for the new decision making framework.]\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [Counties that need alternative approaches are Alpine, Mono, Plumas, Sierra, Trinity because they are in the low confidence category for the new decision making framework.]\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[- How has the reliability of ACS estimates changed over time for small counties like Trinity?\n- Do neighboring census tracts with high MOEs cluster together spatially?]\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [9.28.25]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-yezhanggg/]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Data are selected based on the requirement of the assignment. No major changes to the column names. I picked Los Angeles because it's the largest, Trinity because it had low confidence, Tehama and fall in just right of the moderate confidence level.Analytical Choices can refer back to the full guidance of the assignment.]\n\n**Limitations:**\n[This analysis can go a lot deeper if we could compare things on temporal and spatial perspective. To look at more how things have changed and if there's any relationship because of certain census tract are close with each other.]\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
