##Key Concepts Learned

- We learned about spatial autocorrelation and Tobler's First Law of Geography - near things are more related than distant things
- Moran's I is a diagnostic tool that detects spatial patterns in model errors, revealing if we're missing important spatial relationships
- The key distinction is that spatial lag/error models are for inference about spillover effects, while spatial feature engineering is for prediction

##Coding Techniques

- moran.mc(errors, weights, nsim = 999) tests for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals using Monte Carlo simulation
- Adding progress = FALSE to get_acs(), get_decennial(), and tigris functions suppresses progress messages in rendered documents
- The workflow is: fit model → extract errors → create spatial weights → test Moran's I → add spatial features if needed

##Questions & Challenges

- The biggest challenge is deciding what to do when Moran's I shows significant spatial autocorrelation - should we add more spatial features at different buffer distances or try neighborhood fixed effects?
- Another challenge is avoiding the "simultaneity problem" where using neighbor prices to predict prices creates circular logic and data leakage
- Finding the right balance between capturing spatial relationships and avoiding overfitting requires both statistical testing and domain knowledge

##Connections to Policy

- Spatially clustered model errors can reveal systematic bias in property assessments, leading to inequitable taxation in certain neighborhoods
- Understanding spatial autocorrelation helps policymakers identify spillover effects like how crime or transit investments affect surrounding property values
- This diagnostic approach ensures predictive models don't perpetuate existing geographic inequalities in housing markets

##Reflection

- Moran's I is a diagnostic tool, not a solution - it tells us our model needs improvement but not exactly how to fix it
- The iterative process of checking diagnostics, adding spatial features, and re-testing is essential rather than just relying on R-squared
- Moving forward, I'll always map residuals and test for spatial patterns as part of my standard model evaluation workflow
