## Key Concepts Learned
- We learn some ways to do visualizations and the asethetic mapping. What is a ggplot. We also learned how to join data.

## Coding Techniques
- In class, we learned the basics of ggplot2 and joins in dplyr. In ggplot2, aesthetic mappings like x, y, color, fill, size, shape, and alpha control visual elements such as position, color, and transparency. A typical plot follows the structure ggplot(data) + aes(x, y) + geom_something() + additional_layers(), and layers are added with +. We also covered data joins in dplyr: left_join() keeps all rows from the left dataset, right_join() keeps all from the right, inner_join() keeps only matching rows, and full_join() keeps all rows from both, with left_join() being the most common for adding columns to a main dataset.

## Questions & Challenges
- I think it is very important to follow all the steps correct to make everything work.

## Connections to Policy
- Learning ggplot2 and dplyr helps us turn data into clear visuals and summaries that make policy trends easier to understand. This makes it simpler to spot patterns and share insights that can guide better, data-informed decisions.

## Reflection
- To become more proficient in this process, it requires a lot of time. Even following the class excercise could be challenging. More practice!
