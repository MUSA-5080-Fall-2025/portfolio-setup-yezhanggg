## Key Concepts Learned

- Traditional neighborhood analysis uses snapshots (cross-sectional), but we lose the full trajectory - a "gentrifying" neighborhood in 2010 could have been steadily improving since 1970 OR declined then recovered, which means totally different policy responses
- Sequence analysis treats neighborhood change like DNA sequences - each tract gets a "signature" like `White → White → Hispanic → Hispanic → Hispanic` that captures the full process of change over time
- This method lets us test urban theories: Chicago School predicts regular concentric ring patterns of change, LA School predicts chaotic fragmentation - the data shows Chicago still has rings while LA is more scattered

## Coding Techniques

- K-means clustering on ALL years combined (not separately) ensures temporal consistency - same cluster labels mean same thing across 1980, 1990, 2000, etc.
- Choosing k is "more art than science" - NYC analysis found optimal k=3 mathematically, but used k=6 because k=3 just gave "mostly White, mostly Black, mostly Hispanic" without nuance
- `seqdef()` from TraMineR creates sequence objects from wide-format data where each row is a tract and columns are cluster assignments per year
- OMstrans (Optimal Matching of transitions) is better than regular OM because it captures WHEN transitions happen - "White→Hispanic" in 1990 vs 2010 matters for understanding the process
- Hierarchical clustering with Ward's method on the dissimilarity matrix, then cut the dendrogram - start with many clusters (20-30), merge if patterns similar, stop when you'd group opposite trajectories together

## Questions & Challenges

- Substitution costs in OMstrans are based on transition rarity - rare pathways (Hispanic → Asian) get high costs, common ones (White → White Mixed) get low costs, so neighborhoods following unusual paths are flagged as dissimilar
- The `otto` parameter (origin-transition tradeoff) at 0.1 emphasizes sequencing order over just endpoint comparison
- Most common finding is stability - neighborhoods that don't change, stuck at either high or low end - which is its own policy problem

## Connections to Policy

- Same 2010 snapshot but different histories = different interventions: `Stable → Declining → Gentrifying` needs anti-displacement support, while `Struggling → Struggling → Gentrifying` needs longtime resident wealth-building
- Spatial patterns of trajectory clusters reveal where different processes (decline, gentrification, stability) concentrate geographically
- Can identify which neighborhoods are "stuck" vs volatile, and whether racial/ethnic transitions follow predictable spatial patterns

## Reflection

- This connects to earlier weeks by adding the time dimension we've been building toward - Week 11 did space-time prediction for short-term forecasting, now we're doing long-term historical trajectory analysis
- The unsupervised approach (k-means) means we're not imposing definitions of "gentrifying" or "declining" - letting the data reveal the groupings, though we still make subjective choices about k
- Key insight: mathematical optimum ≠ substantive optimum, have to balance fit metrics with interpretability and theoretical meaning
