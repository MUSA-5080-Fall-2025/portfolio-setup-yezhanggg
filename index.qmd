## About Me
- My name is Ye and I did my Bachelor in Urban Planning at USC ✌️✌️.
- My email is yezhang1@upenn.edu
- My Github user name is yezhanggg
- I think it is a requirement. Also I don't have any prior experience with R and I think it is powerful tool that would be really helpful for me to know. It has so many potential and implications that I could use in multiple areas and projects.
